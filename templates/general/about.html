              What is this site?
	        </h2>
	        <p>
              This is a site designed (initially) to answer a question that every parent, child, and Lego Builder runs
              into; <b>"Can I build that kit (Mellinium Falcon, Death Start etc) with the legos pieces I already have"</b>.
	        </p>
	        <p>
              Anyone can create an account and store their 'Master List' of products and kits. We are building
              a 'manifest' of all the pieces in each kit. As you tell us what kits you already own, we can tell
              you what other kits you can make. 
	        </p>
	        <p>
              We need help! To make this site work, we need to know all the pieces in every kit. This can take some
              work. We a have built tools to allow our users to 'complete' a kit. As you build our your 'Master List'
              you will notice that some of the kits in our system are empty. This means that we need help to get 
              a complete list of all the pieces in that kit. Use the 'Build' a kit option to get started.

              Great Question! With good data comes interesting features. We have been collecting ideas 
              for how to leverage our lego data. We welcome your ideas. Below are a few of ours.
	        </p>
	        <p>
              <b>Lego Cam</b> Imagine dumping all your legos on the floor, and using your smart phone
              to take a photo, and getting an itimzied list of all your pieces. And then browsing this
              site to find other interesting projects to build. 
	        </p>
	        <p>
              <b>Lego C&C</b> Imagine having a customizable build map, similiar to the paper instructions
              you find in all the great lego kit boxes. Imagine making changes and then having a complete
              digital copy that you can share, that others can build from and then modify again. Share 
              with your fields a photo of a lego project, your custom features, and a working instruction
              manual.
	        </p>
	        <p>
              <b>Lego Copier</b> Imagine you want, say, a 'Pink Melliumum Falcon', or a red 'X-Wing Figher',
              simple find the kit and tell our system to convert all the pieces to the color you want. Then
              take the new block list and order them from Lego.

               <b>How do we do it?</b> We are building a complete set of 'manifests' for
               all the lego kits ever made. We have a library of every brick ever made. We
               do the work to determine what pieces you have and what you might need for
               a new kits. And if we have the plans, you can start building.
